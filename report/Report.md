## 1. Prediction Latency

| **Model**        | **Min Time (ms)** | **Max Time (ms)** | **Mean Time (ms)** | **Performance Gain (TRT vs. TF)** |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| **TensorFlow**   | 95.81             | 113.96           | 104.27             | Baseline                           |
| **TensorRT**     | 15.18             | 16.44            | 15.70              | **6.6x faster**                    |

**Explanation**:
- **Key Metric**: Prediction latency measures how quickly the model responds to a single request.
- **Observation**: TensorRT (TRT) achieves significantly lower latency across minimum, maximum, and average times, making it 6.6x faster than TensorFlow.
- **Importance**: Lower latency is crucial for real-time applications, making TRT a more suitable choice for low-latency requirements.

## 2. Throughput (Operations per Second - OPS)

| **Model**        | **OPS (Operations per Second)** | **Performance Gain (TRT vs. TF)** |
|------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **TensorFlow**   | 9.59                            | Baseline                           |
| **TensorRT**     | 63.68                           | **6.6x higher**                    |

**Explanation**:
- **Key Metric**: Throughput indicates the number of operations the model can handle per second.
- **Observation**: TRT achieves 6.6x higher throughput than TensorFlow, indicating it can process significantly more requests in the same time frame.
- **Importance**: High throughput is essential for applications with high traffic or when many predictions need to be handled simultaneously, making TRT more scalable.

## 3. Load Handling and Concurrency

| **Test Case**                        | **TF Mean Time (ms)** | **TRT Mean Time (ms)** | **Performance Gain (TRT vs. TF)** |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| short_text_neutral                   | 94.19                 | 11.33                   | **8.3x faster**                   |
| long_text_positive                   | 93.64                 | 11.20                   | **8.4x faster**                   |
| short_text_negative                  | 94.08                 | 11.71                   | **8x faster**                     |
| short_text_positive                  | 99.93                 | 14.77                   | **6.8x faster**                   |

**Explanation**:
- **Key Metric**: Load handling reflects model performance when managing multiple concurrent requests.
- **Observation**: Across various payloads, TRT consistently achieves mean times that are **6.8x to 8.4x faster** than TensorFlow.
- **Importance**: In high-demand scenarios, TRT’s ability to handle concurrent requests with much lower latency shows it can better support applications requiring high-speed responses and high request volumes.

## 4. Consistency and Stability

| **Model**        | **Mean StdDev (ms)** | **Mean IQR (ms)** | **Outliers**          | **Performance Summary**           |
|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **TensorFlow**   | 8.32                 | 14.64             | Minimal               | Stable but with higher latency    |
| **TensorRT**     | 0.46                 | 0.41              | Minimal               | More consistent and stable        |

**Explanation**:
- **Key Metrics**: Standard deviation and interquartile range (IQR) measure the consistency of response times. Outliers indicate sporadic, unexpected latencies.
- **Observation**: TensorRT shows much lower variability and fewer outliers, indicating a stable, predictable performance compared to TensorFlow.
- **Importance**: Stability is critical in real-time applications as it ensures predictable response times under high loads. This makes TRT more suitable for applications needing consistently low latency without performance spikes.

## 5. Scalability Potential

| **Model**        | **Latency (ms)** | **Throughput (OPS)** | **Stability**               | **Scalability Summary**                       |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **TensorFlow**   | High             | Low                  | Stable                      | Suitable for medium-load applications         |
| **TensorRT**     | Low              | High                 | Consistent, stable          | Better for high-load, low-latency requirements|

**Explanation**:
- **Key Metrics**: Combining latency, throughput, and stability provides a clear view of scalability.
- **Observation**: TRT’s low latency, high throughput, and stable performance make it well-suited for scaling to high loads, while TensorFlow may be more appropriate for applications where high traffic and low latency aren’t critical.
- **Importance**: TRT is better suited for large-scale, high-demand environments due to its efficient handling of concurrent requests and stable performance.
